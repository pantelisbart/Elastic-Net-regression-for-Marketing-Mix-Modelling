# Marketing Mix Modeling with Elastic Net Regression

This document demonstrates the use of Elastic Net regression in R for marketing mix modeling.

## Data Generation

We start by generating synthetic data for advertising spends, seasonality, promotion, and sales.

```R
# Generate sample data
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
youtube_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 5000, sd = 2000)
facebook_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 3000, sd = 1500)
instagram_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 2000, sd = 1000)
tiktok_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 1000, sd = 500)
website_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 4000, sd = 2000)
seasonality <- sample(1:4, n, replace = TRUE) # Assuming four seasons
promotion <- rnorm(n, mean = 1000, sd = 500)
tv_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 6000, sd = 2500)
print_spend <- rnorm(n, mean = 2000, sd = 1000)
sales <- 10000 + 2 * youtube_spend + 1.5 * facebook_spend + 1 * instagram_spend +
  0.5 * tiktok_spend + 2.5 * website_spend + 500 * seasonality +
  5 * promotion + 3 * tv_spend + 1.8 * print_spend + rnorm(n, sd = 5000)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  YouTube = youtube_spend,
  Facebook = facebook_spend,
  Instagram = instagram_spend,
  TikTok = tiktok_spend,
  Website = website_spend,
  Seasonality = seasonality,
  Promotion = promotion,
  TV = tv_spend,
  Print = print_spend,
  Sales = sales
)
# ...

```R
# Split data into predictors and response
X <- as.matrix(data[, -10]) # Predictors
y <- data[, 10] # Response variable (Sales)

# Fit Elastic Net regression model using glmnet
enet_model <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0.5) # 0.5 represents the ratio between Lasso and Ridge penalties

# Plot the cross-validated error as a function of lambda
plot(enet_model)

# Find the optimal lambda value
lambda_optimal <- enet_model$lambda.min

# Get coefficients for the optimal lambda value
coef(enet_model, s = lambda_optimal)

# Predict using the fitted model
predictions <- predict(enet_model, newx = X)

# Assess model performance
cor(predictions, y) # Correlation between predicted and actual sales

# Visualize coefficient paths
plot(enet_model$glmnet.fit, xvar = "lambda", label = TRUE)
# ...
